## K Means
In this problem, you will implement a k-means clustering algorithm and run it on the MNIST dataset.
There are 4 functions to implement in total: 3 in [`k_means.py`](./k_means.py) and 1 in [`main.py`](./main.py).
You should start with functions in `k_means.py`, namely both of the sub-routines: `calculate_centers` and `cluster_data`.
Then, you should implement `lloyd_algorithm`.
Lastly you should go to `main` function in `main.py` file and implement it using functions you've implemented before.

After finishing assignment run the code (e.g., `python homeworks/k_means/main.py`) and in your `.pdf`, submit plots that you have generated.
